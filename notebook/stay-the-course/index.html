    <p class="description">If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.<br><br> But you may miss dinner.</p>

    <p>A common problem with first time or young entrepreneurs is that they are so fearful of screwing up that at the first sign of trouble they jump ship. One of my first experiences starting up a venture was no different.</p>

<p>I was asked to collaborate on a new gaming league trying to change the way online gaming was done. They had a good idea and I loved the vision so I was happy to jump on and assist in anyway I could. After about a year of development and a lot of long hours logged we were starting to approach our release deadline. The only problem was that the rest of the partners kept piling on new features and promising sponsors and advertisers more and more. It was beginning to feel that this league would end up like so many others trying to start up at the same time. Full of empty promises and missed deadlines. So instead of staying on for a failure I decided that I would step aside and put my focus into my school work.</p>

<p>Now 2 years later I am kicking myself. The gaming league, <a href="http://cevolved.com/">Cyber Evolution (CEVO)</a>, has turned into a huge success in gaming. They are the first pay-to-play league and were amazingly successful in all the innovations they brought to the table. And I was the partner who decided that I didn&#39;t want to take the risk after all that time spent on getting them rolling.</p>

<p>Just goes to show you that if you hang in there through the bad times you might just run the risk of having success staring you in the face.</p>
