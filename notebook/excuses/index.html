    <p class="description">It's about that time for me to discuss my lack of content.</p>

    <p>This site has been left idle for almost half of its existence. Every few months, I usually circle back trying to figure out why I struggle with adding new content. And every few months, I usually am able to pinpoint the reason(s) and attempt to correct for it. I don&#39;t like the design. I don&#39;t like the admin interface. I&#39;m too busy to sit down and write. For the most part, this just amounts to me coming up with lame excuses to make myself feel better.</p>

<p>Over the last year, since I switched to a Mac, I&#39;ve found myself becoming more and more comfortable with the command-line. Whether it&#39;s simple tasks around my local machine, connecting and managing remote servers, or managing subversion. A large chunk of my time is in the command-line. And I&#39;ve found I like the command-line. <em>(Just not as an editor, but that&#39;s a story for another day.)</em></p>

<aside>
    This wont be a how-to on Jekyll or even how I have mine set up. If that's what you're after, it is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=Using+Jekyll">already well documented</a>.
</aside>

<p>With that revelation, I&#39;ve decided to take a new approach for this site. I&#39;ve gone the way of a static site generator. While there are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/186290/best-static-website-generator">many options</a> to choose from, I chose to go with <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. To be honest, it was merely the first I tried and suited my needs nicely, so I can&#39;t really compare it to the other options. Also, this isn&#39;t meant as a knock on the previous systems I&#39;ve dabbled with (<a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a>, <a href="http://chyrp.net">Chyrp</a>, <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a>) which are all great solutions as well. But for me, their interfaces always seemed to be a deterrent.</p>

<p>Each of those gave me one more website I need to check. One more thing on the internet that deserved my attention. But it required me to work, so why would I give it priority over the other fun things the internet has to offer? With Jekyll, I&#39;m now able to update my site using my own text editor and some simple command-line work. Nothing new to add to my daily process, just more of the same svn and mate functions.</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m just fooling myself with yet another lame excuse for lack of content.</p>
