    <p class="description">Get more than a lecture out of class. Actually do something with it.</p>

    <p>Over the past two quarters, I think I have learned more about business than I have in all of my quarters combined. Granted, I&#39;m not a business student, but nonetheless the statement still holds true. The main reason for this is the student consultancy projects that <a href="http://neilhair.com/">Dr. Neil Hair</a> incorporates in to his courses. Instead of lecturing for 10 weeks, and then students &quot;brain dumping over a pint at MacGregor&#39;s&quot;, as Neil puts it, we get a hands-on experience to apply the theories he is teaching us to a real life client.</p>

<p>This morning, Neil gave a presentation to the <a href="http://henriettachamberofcommerce.com/">Henrietta Chamber of Commerce</a> promoting these student consultancy projects and to try and get more contacts for businesses who would be interested in being involved with this concept. The whole room, approximately 50 people (excluding the students there to mingle / network), were very accepting of this idea almost to the point of it being a no-brainer for their business. There were some very good questions raised about how these new internet technologies, that Neil focuses on, really affect local businesses. I think the answers, provided by Neil and the students present, really quelled any resistance that a local business owner might have with trying something new and innovative.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing student consultancy projects becoming a bigger part of the RIT curriculum. Just like RIT is known for the co-op program, I hope that it eventually can be known for its student consultancy program as well.</p>
