    <p class="description">Different approaches, same result.</p>

    <p>The other day one of the developers I work with asked me about my approach to a project. At first, I just thought it was a mindless conversation starter, but it was an interesting comparison of our two styles.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Computer Science major. Avid Windows and Linux user. Very precise and calculated. When it comes to my approach to a project I like to go for function over form. I will get all the requirements and start with a general idea of a layout. I will then construct the XHTML framework. Build in necessary functionality. Then design the graphic work and lay it over the functioning website. I call it <em>the structural approach</em> to building a website.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a graphic design / new media major. Mac enthusiast. Emotional attachment to all his work. His approach, <em>the visual approach</em>, is a complete 180 degrees from mine. He prefers getting a client&#39;s style opinion up front and building the site in Photoshop first. Once it is to his and the client&#39;s liking the next step is framing it in HTML. Once skeleton pages are in place, he will put the functionality in place.</p>

<p>I thought it was interesting to hear another idea on how to do things. Not that either way is universally right or wrong. The approach to a project has a great deal to do with the designer / developer involved. Whatever style or approach that works for you is how you should do things. No one has the golden ticket on how it should be done.</p>
