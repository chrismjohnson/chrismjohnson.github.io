    <p class="description">A framework can be so much more than the latest buzzword. Master it and you'll be so much more productive.</p>

    <p>Development frameworks are all the rage right now. Discussions are on going as to which is the best or most useful for speedy development. What is interesting though, is that not much focus is being placed on how frameworks can benefit other parts of the lifecycle.</p>

<p>For any development project to be successful you need an appealing an eye-catching design effort. This is a perfect example of where a framework could be used to improve speed. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/framework">A framework is a skeletal structure designed to support.</a> It does not have to be some third party solution, it can be any structure that fits with your style and implementation.</p>

<p>But, if it is not some solution I download, then how do I use it?</p>

<p>That&#39;s simple, just look at the way you do things when you design. Look at what process you go through in terms of starting on paper before moving into some computer application. What naming convention do you follow for your files you create? What directory structure do you use when you want to keep things organized? All of these things make up what a framework is. By simply analyzing how you work and consolidating it down to be common across all projects you now have built your own framework for your design style.</p>
