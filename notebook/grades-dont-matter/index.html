    <p class="description">All those framed report cards were a waste.</p>

    <p>I know it&#39;s a shock to the U.S. education system, but the grades don&#39;t matter once you&#39;re done. In the grand scheme of things your education process is pass-fail. Once you get the degree at the end, nothing that led to that point matters anymore.</p>

<p>I know way too many students who live and die by their grades. In terms of being the better person and employee you need to use college as your testing ground for the new things you might be interested in branching into.</p>

<p>For example, I used college to build up some ventures and tried to start my own businesses. It&#39;s a safe area where I can let my grades sag slightly and get to try some new things that are of more interest then school per say. So instead of going for the 4.0, I&#39;m able to run a web development company, work part-time, and try to start up two other ventures. When it comes down to decision time for an employer who would you rather have? The perfect student, or the good student with some business experience and signs of ambition?</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s a no brainer.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let yourself fall victim to living and dying by your grades. Not saying to completely abandon school, but it is not the end all be all of your future career. Enjoy your life.</p>
