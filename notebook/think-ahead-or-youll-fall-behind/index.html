    <p class="description">Planning can be essential in efficient work.</p>

    <p>As my Computer Science 4 professor, nicknamed Crazy Vlad, always harped, planning your programming is essential to the best program you can build. He had a tale that I will now pass on to you to get this started.</p>

<p>He was in a graduate Computer Science program with two other individuals all working on the same project. The three of them would be given six months to develop their program to solve a certain task. Person A thought he was going to be a good graduate student and started coding right away. Person B put a little bit more thought behind his actions and planned for 3 months programmed for 3 months. Person C (Crazy Vlad) planned for 6 months and programmed for a day.</p>

<p>When the testing began Person A&#39;s program executed once every week. Person B&#39;s program executed once every hour. Person C&#39;s program execute a dozen times a minute.</p>

<p><strong>Moral:</strong> Planning only helps you in the long run.</p>

<p>Now that that little tidbit is out of the way I&#39;d like to go over some tips to making sure you are able to successfully plan for your project, regardless of the exact implications.</p>

<h2>Step 1 - What are you doing?</h2>

<p>Get a clear answer for what you are doing and planning on implementing. If you are on a team than this should be a strong collaboration between all members. Get all the basic ideas out on the table so everyone knows where they stand and where they want to go.</p>

<h2>Step 2 - What do you need?</h2>

<p>Get the essentials of what needs to be done. <em>The example I am going to stick with is software development but it can be modified to fit.</em> With your program you should figure out what classes you need for your OOP code (if it is) and what functions need to be implemented and by whom.</p>

<p>This is the essential and longest stage. You will need to make sure that everything is planned out and you have a basic road map of how to get to your answer for Step 1. Despite being the most essential state this is <strong>the</strong> step that everyone avoids and skips because it is tedious.</p>

<p>Now the best trick I can give you to making this work is to have a <em>written</em> list for this. Knowing it in your head is not enough. One of my recent projects had the class list and functions list occupy 3 full-size whiteboards each. That&#39;s just a sense of how detailed you should be and how complete they should be.</p>

<h2>Step 3 - Plan your time.</h2>

<p>If you are working alone this is a little bit easier since you aren&#39;t having to manage multiple schedules. But what you need to do is have a distinct order for implementation and a distinct deadline. Also when planning your time for each of the functions and details you should also delegate the task out to others if you are working in a team.</p>

<p>Delegating and organizing everything will greatly help you in making sure things happen in a timely fashion. But the big trick to delegating is exactly that. You must delegate. If you have a clear enough road map then you should be able to hand out tasks to people so that they don&#39;t have to worry about other people&#39;s work. If the timeline is followed, all will come together fairly nicely.</p>

<h2>Step 4 - Double Check</h2>

<p>Think you&#39;re ready? Go back to the beginning. Run through the steps again, quicker this time, and make sure everything is covered. Review all your bases in order to confirm you are ready.</p>

<p>If so, you get to go at it. <strong>Begin the programming.</strong></p>

<p>Now this may seem like an obvious thing to do in order to make sure things run smoothly, but you would be surprised how many people don&#39;t utilize it. Some people get too excited for their own good. Planning and good management can be the strongest leash to control your inner programming animal.</p>
