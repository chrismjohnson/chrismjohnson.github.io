Over the past month or so I have been doing a simple experiment in my habits. During the week, I behave like a 'normal' person and my day starts around 8am and ends around 12am (midnight). I was curious what life was like if I truly became a night person. In my college days, I used a similar schedule as college students do, but that usually was 9am - 4am which is not really being a night person it is just insanity. For the past few weekends, I switch over from my normal 8am - 12am to a 12pm - 4am.

After doing this for a few weeks, I am actually shocked by how little has actually changed in what I do within those waking hours. You might think that such a schedule becomes a hinderance because you're awake when no one else is, but in reality you just gain more hours where you can be focused with the distractions of everyone else. The only change I had to make to still be able to be get errands done and be social was that they came before my work for the day instead of after. So my work hours instead of being 9-5 were now 7pm - 3am.
