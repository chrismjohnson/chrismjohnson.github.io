    <p class="description">A little music can be the key to unlocking your creative juices.</p>

    <p>With the start of 2006, I&#39;ve taken on a lot more design work to try and step up my status as a freelance designer. It was a risky decision taking on so many projects at the same time, but I am currently getting through it all. How am I doing it?</p>

<p>My hidden secret, that I&#39;ve just pulled out of retirement, is my handy iPod. The song lists are a little out of date and I no longer have iTunes installed to manage some playlists, but it has been a nice change of pace to aid in the design process.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what it is, but sitting down to my desk and throwing my headphones on I just get lost in the time and in the computer screen. Last night, I had a streak of an hour where I came up with 11 concept designs that I spent today fleshing out.</p>

<p>Needless to say that I think I&#39;m going to keep up this practice of using my iPod and drowning out the world around me with music, oh sweet music. :) Now some of you, probably none but I still like to boost my ego, might be wondering what exactly it is that I listen to. When it boils down to it, the music doesn&#39;t really matter and I just need something in the background. But I prefer listening to either alternative, rock, or classic rock. Occasionally the techno or country gets brought out if I&#39;m looking for a certain style. But as long as it&#39;s not rap and classical music it&#39;ll be allowed onto my iPod.</p>

<p>What do some of you other designers and developers use for music while you work?</p>
