    <p class="description">Customer service at its finest.</p>

    <p>Treat all of your clients the same way. Treat them as if they are your most important client and your only client, whether or not this is true. By doing this, you can turn almost any client&#39;s opinion for the better. With the amount of web design and web development &quot;studios&quot; and freelancers that are popping up all over the web, it can never hurt to have too much good word of mouth going in your favor. From working with my clients, I have a few tips &amp; tricks as to what are good things to do and bad things to do.</p>

<h2>Be Polite</h2>

<p>We&#39;re going to start off with the easy one. Just be polite and courteous in your communications, whatever medium they be. Being polite not only respects the client, but shows them you have a respect for yourself and your business.</p>

<h2>Be Prompt</h2>

<p>I am an email freak. I hate having emails sit in my Inbox without a follow up response. I know that sometimes when working with team members or contractors I am unsure as to whether or not they go my email or message. It&#39;s just a nice courtesy to send a quick reply of acknowledgment.</p>

<h2>Be Thorough</h2>

<p>Make sure to get across all of your thoughts and cover all your bases when working with a client. It looks very unorganized to have to come back to a subject because you skipped it or forgot about it. Show them that you are considering every possible aspect.</p>

<h2>Be Calm</h2>

<p>You will eventually come across your fair share of bad clients. Don&#39;t let your emotions get the best of you, even if they let their emotions get the best of them. Stay relaxed and always act in a professional manner.</p>

<p>Okay, so maybe they are all nice and easy little steps. But trust me, they go a long way to making the client feel that they are being tended to.</p>
