    <p class="description">The media loves an overnight success. Now if we could only make it actually happen.</p>

    <p>The driving force behind most entrepreneurs, at least at the young and naive stage, is that inspirational overnight success story. Everyone has heard them the stories that say &quot;Yeah, even I made it work!&quot; But guess what they&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p><center><em>There is no such thing as overnight success.</em></center></p>

<p>You may achieve overnight popularity and publicity. But I guarantee that any venture you want to work on will take weeks, more likely months, to get off the ground. There is just too much stuff to do to be successful for it to all occur overnight (unless of course you utilize massive slave labor farms that work while you sleep, but we wont go in to that).</p>

<p>The key to success is not finding that brilliant idea that will serve as your get rich quick scheme, but rather to persevere and put your heart and soul into the business you&#39;re building. You will achieve the rewards of what you put into your start-up.</p>
