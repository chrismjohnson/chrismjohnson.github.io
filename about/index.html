<section id="bio">
  <aside><p>I am happily employed full-time, but if you want more professional details check out <a href="/resume">my resume</a>.</p></aside>
  <p>I am a NYC-based web technologist trying to make the internet better by crafting accessible, usable, and interesting web experiences for companies of all sizes.</p>
  <p>Currently the Director of Backend Development at <a href="http://connectedventures.com">Connected Ventures</a> keeping you distracted from work with <a href="http://collegehumor.com">CollegeHumor</a>, <a href="http://dorkly.com">Dorkly</a>, <a href="http://sportspickle.com">SportsPickle</a>, &amp; <a href="http://todaysbigthing.com">Today's Big Thing</a>. I also work on a few side projects, take the occasional freelance clients, and consult with a couple of startups.</p>
  <p>My interests aren't strictly limited to development. Design, usability, architecture, psychology and business are some of the areas that I try to incorporate in to a well-rounded approach for each and every project that I contribute to. This makes me a jack-of-many-trades, but definitely not a master of none.</p>
  <p>When not working <small><em>(which is rarer than I'd like to admit)</em></small>, I'm a big hockey fan, a dabbling amateur drummer, a bi-polar pool shark, and a movie fanatic.</p>

  <h2>The Site</h2>
  <p>This site is my personal playground. While I might not be the most reliable <a href="/notebook">writer</a>, I spend a lot of time tinkering under the hood trying out new techniques.</p>
  <p>For this iteration, the site is being published as static files generated by <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> which gives me the free-time to tinker more without having to worry about a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> getting in the way.</p>
  <aside><p>Feel free to look under the hood and poke around. Questions?<br> <a href="mailto:chris@chrismjohnson.com">Let me know</a>.</p></aside>
  <p>I haven't validated the markup or tested in every browser, but the code should be valid, semantic, and cross-browser compatible. If you see a bug, <a href="mailto:chris@chrismjohnson.com">let me know</a>. Viewing source code is how I learned, so I also try to keep the code clean and readable.</p>
  <p><a href="http://chrismjohnson.com/">This domain</a>, registered in 2001 with <a href="http://dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>, is not my first home on the internet. I have gone through many domains dating back to 1997. Looking back on many of my previous domains, I am a bit embarrassed and don't like to re-count them, but I think this domain will be here to stay as my home on the web.</p>
